    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The company is exploring a new business venture: purchasing and operating aircraft for both commercial and private services. Before making such a significant investment, leadership needs to understand which aircraft models present the lowest operational risk. This project uses historical accident data from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify the safest aircraft types and provide clear, evidence-based recommendations. The analysis focuses on real-world aviation accident records from 1962 through 2023."

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "The key stakeholder is the head of the new Aviation Division. Their central question is: **Which aircraft models are the safest to acquire and operate?** To answer this, we will clean and explore the NTSB accident dataset, calculate risk metrics such as fatal- or serious-injury rates, and evaluate how different aircraft characteristics, flight conditions, and operational factors contribute to accident severity. The end result will be a set of actionable insights, backed by data, that guide purchase decisions and reduce safety risks."
